### Get Started
Install dependencies

    $ npm install

Run script   

    $ node loadTest.js

Your Postman collection can be exported as a JSON file and run from your local file system, as in this example here. Alternatively, you can use the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) to access the latest version of your collection. The second approach is recommended if you plan to update the collection.
